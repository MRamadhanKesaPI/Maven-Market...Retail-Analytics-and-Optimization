# Intregated Business Analytics

## Project Background
Maven Market, established in the mid-1990s, is a fictional retail brand specializing in a diverse range of consumer products. Over the years, it has expanded operations across North America, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico. By 1997, Maven Market had gathered substantial sales, product, and customer data, yet these datasets were underutilized for strategic decision-making.

This project thoroughly analyzes two years of historical data (1997–1998) to uncover actionable insights that can drive profitability, optimize product offerings, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency. The analysis is centered around evaluating sales performance, product trends, customer behaviors, and store operations to provide recommendations for business improvement.

#### Insights and Recommendations Focus
The project explores and provides actionable insights across the following critical business dimensions:

1. Sales Trends Analysis
Evaluation of topline performance, including revenue trends, order volume, and profit margins.

2. Product Performance
Assessment of profit margins, product sales targets, and the impact of returns.

3. Customer Behavior Analysis
Analysis of customer retention and acquisition patterns over two years.

4. Operational Efficiency
Store performance evaluation by country and revenue per square foot.


## Project Assets

Before beginning the analysis, comprehensive quality checks were performed to ensure data preparation and to familiarize with Maven Market's datasets. The SQL queries for data preparation can be found [here](https://mramadhankesapi.github.io/SQL-Queries-for-for-Rama-Kesa-Portfolio/)


## Executive Summary
#### Overview of Finding
Maven Market has achieved strong financial results, with a $1.05M profit and a 59% profit margin, driven by rapid growth in 1998 from expanding into Mexico and Canada. Revenue has increased by 112% compared to last year, thanks to expansion and strong product performance.

The USA is still the top revenue source, but Mexico’s rapid growth shows it could compete with the USA soon. Hermano is the top-selling brand, making up 3.21% of total sales, indicating high customer demand. Notably, Plato stands out with the highest profit margin of 63.6%, despite lower revenue, showing great operational efficiency. The next sections will look at key factors behind this performance and explore opportunities for growth.

Below is an overview from the Power BI dashboard, with additional examples provided throughout the report.
