# Intregated Business Analytics

## Project Background
Maven Market, established in the mid-1990s, is a fictional retail brand specializing in a diverse range of consumer products. Over the years, it has expanded operations across North America, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico. By 1997, Maven Market had gathered substantial sales, product, and customer data, yet these datasets were underutilized for strategic decision-making.

This project thoroughly analyzes two years of historical data (1997â€“1998) to uncover actionable insights that can drive profitability, optimize product offerings, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency. The analysis is centered around evaluating sales performance, product trends, customer behaviors, and store operations to provide recommendations for business improvement.

#### Insights and Recommendations Focus
The project explores and provides actionable insights across the following critical business dimensions:

1. Sales Trends Analysis
Evaluation of topline performance, including revenue trends, order volume, and profit margins.

2. Product Performance
Assessment of profit margins, product sales targets, and the impact of returns.

3. Customer Behavior Analysis
Analysis of customer retention and acquisition patterns over two years.

4. Operational Efficiency
Store performance evaluation by country and revenue per square foot.
